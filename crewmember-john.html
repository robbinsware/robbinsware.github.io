                <h4>ABOUT:</h4>

                <br> <br> 
                A graduate of University of Washington's Physics and Applied Computational Mathematics programs, I accepted a commission and served for 13 years as a pilot in the United States Air Force.  During my career I flew around the globe, twice, and to all seven continents.  I had the opportunity to deliver supplies to the remote corners of Afghanistan in command of multiple combat airdrop missions in the C-17A.  I also had the opportunity to ensure the "Safe, Comfortable and Reliable" transportation of our nation's senior military and civilian leadership to locations all over the globe in a modified Gulfstream V.   
                <br>
                <br>
                During my service to the nation I frequently encountered inefficient and outdated processes and work efforts.  Using the computer science component of my undergraduate education as a foundation and my knack for understanding code, I began to develop software to help make our work more efficient, accurate and most of all safe.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Seeing the potential of many of my projects, I recently separated Active Service in order to pursue the development and expansion of what my fellow pilots affectionally dubbed "Robbinsware".
